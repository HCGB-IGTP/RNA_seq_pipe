We have included folders python/ and software/ with information regarding the requirements and dependencies for configuration of the pipeline.

- Save python modules:
$ pip list --format freeze | sed 's/\=\=/,/' > rnaseqpipe/config/python/python_requirements.csv
$ awk -F',' '{print $1}' rnaseqpipe/config/python/python_requirements.csv > rnaseqpipe/config/python/python_requirement_summary.txt

The CSV file is read by python during the config module and the TXT file by setup.py during installation




- Save software dependencies:


These files are not included by default in a python package, we have to create a MANIFEST.in file with these information.
